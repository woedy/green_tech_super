# Green Admin Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind (shadcn-ui)

Commands:
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

This app is the Admin/Ops portal scaffold. It currently mirrors configs from the existing frontend; next step is to scaffold admin routes per `green_frontend.md` (Login, Plans, Properties, Users, Regions, Notifications, Analytics).
