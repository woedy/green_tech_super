  - Date formatting (DD/MM/YYYY) verification
  - Regional pricing multiplier accuracy testing

### 5. Integration Tests for Cross-Portal Functionality
- **WebSocket Integration Tests:**
  - Real-time notification delivery verification
  - User preference respect testing
  - Admin monitoring functionality
  - Bulk notification sending

- **Data Consistency Tests:**
  - Customer request → Agent lead → Admin analytics flow
  - Project updates across all portals
  - Notification synchronization
  - User role-based access verification

## 🌍 Ghana-Specific Features

### Localization
- **Language Support:** English and Twi message templates
- **Currency:** Ghana Cedis (GHS) formatting with proper comma separation
- **Phone Numbers:** +233 country code formatting
- **Dates:** DD/MM/YYYY format (Ghana standard)

### Regional Considerations
- **Business Hours:** 8 AM - 6 PM Ghana time for non-urgent notifications
- **Network Optimization:** SMS message length limits for mobile networks
- **Regional Pricing:** Different cost multipliers for Greater Accra, Ashanti, Northern, and Western regions
- **Connectivity:** Offline functionality and slow network handling

### Market Simulation
- **Internet Speeds:** 2G/3G network condition simulation
- **Mobile-First:** Testing on common Ghana mobile devices (Pixel 5, iPhone 12)
- **Connectivity Issues:** Automatic reconnection and data synchronization
- **Regional Data:** Ghana cities, regions, and local preferences
